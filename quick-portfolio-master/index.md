This project involves sentiment analysis of text from Yelp reviews of various businesses. The task is to predict the number of stars (1-5) from the corresponding rating text. As the dataset is imbalanced in favour of 5-star reviews, F1 score is used as the evaluation metric instead of accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that the best model (logistic regression) outperformed all CNN/RNN-based models we tested, though both had a validation F1 score ~10% higher than the baseline given by our instructor.
