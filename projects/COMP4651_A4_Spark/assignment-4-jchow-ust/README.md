# COMP4651 Assignment-4 (8 marks)

### Deadline: April 17, 23:59 (Sunday)
---

In this assignment, you will write two Spark applications: word count (`word_count.ipynb`) and server log analysis (`log_analysis.ipynb`). This assignment repo consists of the following three notebooks:

* `warmup_notebook.ipynb`: Warmup and environment testing (no grading)
* `word_count.ipynb`: WordCount application (**4 marks**)
* `log_analysis.ipynb`: Apache log analysis (**4 marks**)

**Note:** Make sure you have completed self-paced Spark tutorial. We will be running the three notebooks on **the same platform** (Databricks) for the tutorial.

The following instructions assume that you have successfully imported the notebook to your workspace. If you don't know how, please refer to `README.md` file in the repo of the self-paced Spark tutorial.

## Warmup and Environment Testing (**no grading**)

We strongly recommend you test your environment before getting started. Import and open `warmup_notebook.ipynb` in your web browser and follow the instructions there.

## Task-1: Word Count Application (**4 marks**)

Open the notebook file (`word_count.ipynb`) in your web browser and follow the instructions carefully. Once you've done coding, you'll submit your Python code to GitHub for autograding. You'll also need to explain your code to TA in the labs on April 19.

### Grading

* **Autograding (2 marks)**: You need to download the assignment code from your Databricks workspace. In the notebook web UI, you can click on "File", then hovering your mouse over "Export", and then clicking on "Source File". This will export your notebook as a `word_count.py` file to your computer. You can `git add` this file, then commit and push it to GitHub to submit your code.
* **Code explanation (2 marks)**: In the lab sessions on April 19, the TA will ask you to explain your code.

The autograder will give an *all-or-nothing* mark. That is, you will get no mark unless you have successfully completed **all** parts of this coding task.

## Task-2: Apache Web Server Log Analysis (**4 marks**)

Open the notebook file (`log_analysis.ipynb`) in your web browser and follow the instructions carefully. Once you're done coding, you'll submit your python code for autograding. You'll also explain your code to TA in the lab sessions on April 19. 

### Grading

The grading scheme is exactly the same as that of Task-1: 2 marks for autograding and 2 for code explanation in the labs on April 19.
